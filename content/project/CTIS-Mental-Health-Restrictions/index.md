# The impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health during COVID 19 in Germany

This project utilizes data from the Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS) and Corona data Germany to access the **the impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health during COVID 19 in Germany**

## Paper Link

The complete paper can be accessed here: [LINK]().

## Findings and Summary

### Results:

- The impact of pandemic restrictions on mental health was small to minimal, which is contrary and consistent with some studies.
- No clear associations were found between containment measures (covariates) and mental health variables.
- Significant associations were observed between age, gender, education level, and employment status with the likelihood of anxiety and depression, which is consistent with other mental health studies.

### Limitations:

- The presence of bias from the sample used in the study.
- The measurement of mental health and pandemic restrictions.

### Further research
- Inclusion of other variables
- Inclusion of pre-pandemic mental health data
- Inclusion of different cultural, social, and economic contexts.

## Data Used

- [The Global COVID-19 Trends and Impact Survey (CTIS)](https://covidmap.umd.edu/):

  - A global online survey conducted through Facebook during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  - United States data is not included, and countries without access to Facebook are also excluded.
  - The study was conducted from April 6, 2020, to June 25, 2022.

- [Corona data Germany](https://www.corona-daten-deutschland.de/):
  - Secondary data source for this project.
  - Provides small area data on the COVID-19 crisis in Germany.
  - Includes daily information on regional containment measures.
