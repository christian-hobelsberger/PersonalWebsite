# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on public mental health has been a widely discussed topic, particularly regarding the effectiveness of the various countermeasures implemented to address the crisis. Previous work suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased levels of mental distress worldwide. In contrast to other study studies that focused on a specific country or continent, we analysed the impact on the global mental health. We use the UMD Global CTIS survey, policy response information as well as Google trends data provided from Our World in Data. As part of our exploratory data analysis we built a Shiny App displaying important mental health metrics from the data. Our results show a trend in mental health, with older people being more resilient to the effects of the pandemic than young adults. Respondents with a lower educational level were more likely to report mental health problems than people with a higher educational level. Further, we found that worries about the financial situation, food security as well as concerns of becoming ill seem to negatively impact the mental health of respondents globally.
