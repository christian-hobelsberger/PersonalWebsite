I am a statistics student at LMU Munich, majoring in statistics and computer science. I am currently working as a Data Science Working Student at Telefonica Germany. My interests include time series analysis, statistical models, and cost-effective machine learning algorithms.

In my free time, I dedicate myself to [teaching chess](https://gym-muc-moosach.musin.de/faecher/schachklub/) to kids at my local school and building cool stuff.
