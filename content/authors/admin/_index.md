I am a student at LMU Munich, majoring in Statistics & Data Science. I am currently working at Munich Re as part of an integrated study program and a M.Sc. student at the Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI ([relAI](https://zuseschoolrelai.de)). My interests include time series analysis, statistical models, and cost-effective machine learning algorithms.

In my free time, I dedicate myself to [teaching chess](https://gym-muc-moosach.musin.de/faecher/schachklub/) to kids at my local school and building cool stuff.
